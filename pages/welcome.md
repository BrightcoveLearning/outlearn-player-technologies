# Welcome to the Technologies for Player Developers Learning Path
This learning path is designed for developers who will be working with the Brightcove Player.

Since the player is built with web technologies - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - you need skills in these technologies to effectively work with the player.

This learning path doesn't offer full tutorials on any of the technologies - that would be overwhelming, and is not the way any developer learns new languages. Instead, we'll focus on the parts of these languages that will be most useful to you in working with a Brightcove video player.

Below is the solution - a custom playlist player that you will learn to build over the course of this tutorial:

## HTML
HTML is the simplest of the three languages, and the least important one in this context, as the player itself includes all the HTML it needs. However, you may need to add additional HTML for `text tracks`, which can be used to display captions or subtitles, or to specify chapters within the video. You might also want to display a video playlist. We'll focus on the HTML you need to do these things.

## CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to provide formatting for HTML content. CSS has several important uses for video players, such as:
- sizing the player responsively
- styling the controls
- styling associated displays such as video playlists

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to control player functionality and other aspects of the web page. You don't necessarily have to write any JavaScript to use the Brightcove player, as it already includes the script it needs to handle basic video playback. However, you may want to add additional JavaScript to add functionality such as:
- loading new videos into the player
- displaying information about the current video
- adding some kind of call-to-action that appears when the video ends
