## Getting Started

In the last module, we covered a little bit of HTML to see how you can add content around a Brightcove player. In this module, we'll see how to use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style the content.

> Remember that the player itself is just HTML, so you can also use CSS to modify the player appearance. There are some extra complexities associated with that, however, so here we'll focus on styling content around the player. Once you are comfortable with that, try [Quick Start to Customizing the Player](http://docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/brightcove-player/guides/customize-quick-start.html).

## Using Markdown
You may have already used Markdown. It's an awesome format for technical publishing. If you need a refresher, GitHub has a great overview.

<!-- @link, "url" : "https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/", "text": "I know enough about Markdown." -->

GitHub-flavored markdown will work just fine, and you can preview your files in your favorite text editor or Markdown preview tool before uploading them to Outlearn for final proof-reading.

If you want to enrich your content with more features, this sample module has a few examples, including the Unfurled Link above, and the interactive features described in the next section.

> Block quotes get special styling on Outlearn. They turn into highlight boxes.

# Images and videos
You can include images using Markdown syntax.

# Let's make our module Fancy
If you want to get your audience to practice what you preach, give them a task.

```python
# Transpose a matrix:
>>> l = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> zip(*l)
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]

# Divide a list into groups of n:
>>> l = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8]
>>> zip(*[iter(l)] * 3)
[(3, 1, 4), (1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 5), (3, 5, 8)]
```

<!-- @task, "text" : "Go and run these clever code examples on your own machine, lazy bones!"-->

And if they are making something worth sharing, why not let them share it with you?  

<!-- @task, "hasDeliverable" : true, "text" : "Write and submit a haiku about your favorite compiler."-->

Then go ahead and test how much they know.

<!-- @multipleChoice -->

You can add a matrix and its transpose together only if
- [ ] The elements of the matrix are integers
- [ ] The matrix has an inverse
- [X] The matrix is a square matrix

Remember that two matrices can be added if they have the same number of rows and columns.
